                    Supplier Performance Dashboard -Procurement KPI Analytics
                      Project Overview
This project analyzes procurement operations using real-world-inspired purchase order data to evaluate supplier performance and operational efficiency. Using Excel and Power BI, the project applies key procurement KPIs-such as cost savings, on-time delivery, defect rates, and compliance-to generate actionable insights that support data-driven supplier management decisions.
The outcome is an interactive supplier performance dashboard designed to help procurement teams monitor vendor reliability, identify risks, and uncover cost-saving opportunities.

                                                 Business Problem
Procurement teams must balance cost control, delivery reliability, and product quality while managing multiple suppliers. Poor supplier performance can lead to delayed operations, increased costs, and quality risks.
This project addresses the question:
How can procurement teams objectively evaluate supplier performance using data and KPIs to support better sourcing and negotiation decisions?
