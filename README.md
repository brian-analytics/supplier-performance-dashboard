Supplier Performance Dashboard – Procurement KPI Analytics

This project analyzes procurement operations using real-world-inspired data to evaluate supplier performance and operational efficiency. Built using Excel and Power BI, it applies key procurement KPIs such as cost savings, delivery timeliness, and defect rates to uncover actionable insights.

**Project Objective**

To design a data-driven supplier scorecard that enables supply chain teams to:
- Identify underperforming vendors
- Visualize trends in delivery delays and compliance
- Quantify cost savings from negotiations
- Track defect rates across suppliers and categories

**Dataset Overview**

- Source: Kaggle – Procurement KPI Dataset (anonymized real-world POs) : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahriarkabir/procurement-kpi-analysis-dataset
- Size: 777 Purchase Orders (2022–2023)
- Key Columns:
  - Supplier, Order_Date, Delivery_Date
  - Unit_Price, Negotiated_Price, Quantity
  - Defective_Units, Compliance, Order_Status

**KPIs Calculated**

| KPI                  | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| On-Time Delivery     | Whether delivery was made on or before schedule |
| Cost Savings         | Difference between unit price and negotiated rate |
| Defect Rate          | % of units returned or defective                |
| Compliance Rate      | % of orders marked “Compliant”                  |
| Delivery Delay (days)| Lag between order and delivery                   |

**Tools Used**
- Excel – for data cleaning and KPI calculations
- Power BI – for visual dashboard and drill-down analysis
- (Power BI dashboard screenshots to be added)

**Key Insights (to be updated)**

- Supplier B shows frequent delays despite low defect rates
- Office Supplies had the highest cost variance across all categories
- High-compliance vendors tended to deliver fewer defective items
